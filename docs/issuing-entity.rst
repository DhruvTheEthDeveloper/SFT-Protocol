IssuingEntity
#############

IssuingEntity contracts hold shared compliance logic for all security tokens created by a single issuer. They are the central contract that an issuer uses to connect and interact with registrars, tokens and custodians.

Each issuer contract includes standard SFT protocol multis-gi functionality. See :ref:`multisig` for detailed information on this component.

This documentation only explains contract methods that are meant to be accessed directly. External methods that will revert unless called through another contract, such as a token or module, are not included.

It may be useful to also view the `IsssuingEntity.sol <https://github.com/zerolawtech/SFT-Protocol/blob/master/contracts/IssuingEntity.sol>`__ source code while reading this document.

Deployment
==========

The constructor declares the owner as per standard :ref:`multisig`.

.. method:: IssuingEntity.constructor(address[] _owners, uint32 _threshold)

    * ``_owners``: One or more addresses to associate with the contract owner. The address deploying the contract is not implicitly included within the owner list.
    * ``_threshold``: The number of calls required for the owner to perform a multi-sig action.

    The ID of the owner is generated as a keccak of the contract address and available from the public getter ``ownerID``.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer = accounts[0].deploy(IssuingEntity, [accounts[0], accounts[1]], 1)

        Transaction sent: 0xb37d8d16b266796e64fde6a4e9813ae0673dddaeb63022d91c706612ee741972

Public Constants
================

The following public variables cannot be changed after contract deployment.

.. method:: IssuingEntity.ownerID()

    The bytes32 ID hash of the issuer.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.ownerID()
        0xce1e12589ad8fb3eed11af5b9ef8788c25b574d4073d23c871e003021400c429

Tokens, Registrars, Custodians, Governance
==========================================

The ``IssuingEntity`` contract is a center point through which other contracts are linked. Each contract must be associated to it before it will function properly.

* :ref:`security-token` contracts must be associated before tokens can be transferred, so that the issuer contract can accurately track investor counts.
* :ref:`kyc` contracts must be associated to provide KYC data on investors before they can receive or send tokens.
* :ref:`custodian` contracts must be approved in order to send or receive tokens from investors.
* A :ref:`governance` contract may optionally be associated. Once attached, it requires the issuer to receive on-chain approval before creating or minting additional tokens.

Associating Contracts
---------------------

.. method:: IssuingEntity.addToken(address _token)

    Associates a new :ref:`security-token` contract with the issuer contract.

    Once added, the token can be restricted with ``IssuingEntity.setTokenRestriction``.

    If a :ref:`governance` module has been set, it must provide approval whenever this method is called.

    Emits the ``TokenAdded`` event.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.addToken(SecurityToken[0], {'from': accounts[0]})

        Transaction sent: 0x8e93cd6b85d1e993755e9fe31eb14ce600706eaf98d606156447d8e431db5db9

.. method:: IssuingEntity.setRegistrar(address _registrar, bool _permitted)

    Associates or removes a :ref:`kyc` contract.

    Before a transfer is completed, each associated registrar is called to check which IDs are associated to the transfer addresses.

    The address => ID association is stored within IssuingEntity. If a registrar is later removed it is impossible for another registrar to return a different ID for the address.

    When a registrar is removed, any investors that were identified through it will be unable to send or receive tokens until they are identified through another associated registrar. Transfer attempts will revert with the message "Registrar restricted".

    Emits the ``RegistrarSet`` event.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.setRegistrar(KYCRegistrar[0], True, {'from': accounts[0]})

        Transaction sent: 0x606326c8b2b8f1541c333ef5a5cd44592efb50530c6326e260e728095b3ec2bd

.. method:: IssuingEntity.addCustodian(address _custodian)

    Approves a :ref:`custodian` contract to send and receive tokens associated with the issuer.

    Once a custodian has been added, they can be restricted with ``IssuingEntity.setEntityRestriction``.

    Emits the ``CustodianAdded`` event.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.addCustodian(OwnedCustodian[0])

        Transaction sent: 0xbae451ce98691dc37dad6a67d8daf410a3eeebf34b59ab60eaeef7c3f3a2654c

.. method:: IssuingEntity.setGovernance(address _governance)

    Sets the active :ref:`Governance` contract.

    Setting the address to ``0x00`` disables governance functionality.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.setGovernance(GovernanceMinimal[0])

        Transaction sent: 0x8e93cd6b85d1e993755e9fe31eb14ce600706eaf98d606156447d8e431db5db9

Setting Restrictions
--------------------

Transfer restrictions can be applied at varying levels.

.. method:: IssuingEntity.setEntityRestriction(bytes32 _id, bool _permitted)

    Retricts or permits an investor or custodian from transferring tokens, based on their ID.

    This can only be used to block an investor that would otherwise be able to hold the tokens. It cannot be used to whitelist investors who are not listed in an associated registrar. When an investor is restricted, the issuer is still able to transfer tokens from their addresses.

    Emits the ``EntityRestriction`` event.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> SecurityToken[0].transfer(accounts[2], 100, {'from': accounts[1]})

        Transaction sent: 0x89bf6113bd5ccf9917d0749776fa4bed986d519d66221973def33c0190a2e6d2

          raise VirtualMachineError(e)
        VirtualMachineError: VM Exception while processing transaction: revert Sender restricted: Issuer

.. method:: IssuingEntity.setTokenRestriction(address _token, bool _permitted)

    Restricts or permits transfers of a token. When a token is restricted, only the issuer may perform transfers.

    Emits the ``TokenRestriction`` event.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.setTokenRestriction(SecurityToken[0], False, {'from': accounts[0]})

        Transaction sent: 0xfe60d18d0315278bdd1cfd0896a040cdadb63ada255685737908672c0cd10cee

.. method:: IssuingEntity.setGlobalRestriction(bool _permitted)

    Restricts or permits transfers of all associated tokens. Modifying the global restriction does not affect individual token restrictions - i.e. you cannot call this method to remove restrictions that were set with ``IssuingEntity.setTokenRestriction``.

    Emits the ``GlobalRestriction`` event.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.setGlobalRestriction(False, {'from': accounts[0]})

        Transaction sent: 0xc03ac4c6d36e971f980297e365f30752ac5097e391213c59fd52544829a87479

Getters
-------

.. method:: IssuingEntity.isActiveToken(address _token)

    Returns a boolean indicating if the given address is a token contract that is associated with the ``IssuingEntity`` not currently restricted.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.isActiveToken(SecurityToken[0])
        True
        >>> issuer.isActiveToken(accounts[2])
        False

.. method:: IssuingEntity.governance()

    Returns the address of the associated ``Governance`` contract. If none is set, returns ``0x00``.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.governance()
        "0x14b0Ed2a7C4cC60DD8F676AE44D0831d3c9b2a9E"

Investors
=========

Investors must be identified by a :ref:`kyc` before they can send or receive tokens. This identity data is then used to apply further checks against investor limits and accreditation requirements.

Getters
-------

The ``IssuingEntity`` contract contains several public getter methods for querying information relating to investors.

.. method:: IssuingEntity.isRegisteredInvestor(address _addr)

    Check if an address belongs to a registered investor and return a bool. Returns ``false`` if the address is not registered.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.isRegisteredInvestor(accoounts[2])
        True
        >>> issuer.isRegisteredInvestor(accoounts[9])
        False

.. method:: IssuingEntity.getID(address _addr)

    Returns the investor ID associated with an address. If the address is not saved in the contract, this call will query associated registrars. If the ID cannot be found the call will revert.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.getID(accounts[1])
        0x8be1198d7f1848ebeddb3f807146ce7d26e63d3b6715f27697428ddb52db9b63
        >>> issuer.getID(accounts[9])
        File "contract.py", line 277, in call
          raise VirtualMachineError(e)
        VirtualMachineError: VM Exception while processing transaction: revert Address not registered

.. method:: IssuingEntity.getInvestorRegistrar(bytes32 _id)

    Returns the registrar address associated with an investor ID. If the investor ID is not saved in the ``IssuingEntity`` contract storage, this call will return ``0x00``.

    Note that an investor's ID is only saved in the contract after a successful token transfer. Even if the investor's ID is known via an associated registrar, if they have never received tokens the call to ``getInvestorRegistrar`` will return an empty value.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> id_ = issuer.getID(accounts[1])
        0x8be1198d7f1848ebeddb3f807146ce7d26e63d3b6715f27697428ddb52db9b63
        >>> issuer.getInvestorRegistrar(id_)
        0xa79269260195879dBA8CEFF2767B7F2B5F2a54D8

Investor Limits
===============

Issuers can define investor limits globally, by country, by investor rating, or by a combination thereof. These limits are shared across all tokens associated to the issuer.

Investor counts and limits are stored in uint32[8] arrays. The first entry in each array is the sum of all the remaining entries. The remaining entries correspond to the count or limit for each investor rating. In most (if not all) countries there will be less than 7 types of investor accreditation ratings, and so the upper range of these arrays will be empty. Setting an investor limit to 0 means no limit is imposed.

The issuer must explicitely approve each country from which investors are allowed to purchase tokens.

It is possible for an issuer to set a limit that is lower than the current investor count. When a limit is met or exceeded existing investors are still able to receive tokens, but new investors are blocked.

Setters
-------

.. method:: IssuingEntity.setCountry(uint16 _country, bool _permitted, uint8 _minRating, uint32[8] _limits)

    Approve or restrict a country, and/or modify it's minimum investor rating and investor limits.

    * ``_country``: The code of the country to modify
    * ``_permitted``: Permission bool
    * ``_minRating``: The minimum rating required for an investor in this country to hold tokens. Cannot be zero.
    * ``_limits``: A uint32[8] array of investor limits for this country.

    Emits the ``CountryModified`` event.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.setCountry(784, True, 1, [100, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], {'from': accounts[0]})

        Transaction sent: 0x96f9a7e12e898fbd2fb6c7593a7ae82c4eea087c508929e616f86e98ae9b0db6
        IssuingEntity.setCountry confirmed - block: 26   gas used: 116709 (1.46%)
        <Transaction object '0x96f9a7e12e898fbd2fb6c7593a7ae82c4eea087c508929e616f86e98ae9b0db6'>

.. method:: IssuingEntity.setCountries(uint16[] _country, uint8[] _minRating, uint32[] _limit)

    Approve many countries at once.

    * ``_countries``: An array of country codes to modify
    * ``_minRating``: Array of minimum investor ratings for each country.
    * ``_limits``: Array of total investor limits for each country.

    Each array must be the same length. The function will iterate through them at the same time: ``_countries[0]`` will require rating ``_minRating[0]`` and have a total investor limit of ``_limits[0]``.

    This method is useful when approving many countries that do not require specific limits based on investor ratings. When you require specific limits for each rating or to explicitly restrict an entire country, use ``IssuingEntity.setCountry``.

    Emits the ``CountryModified`` event once for each country that is modified.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.setCountries([784],[1],[0], {'from': accounts[0]})

        Transaction sent: 0x7299b96013acb4661f4b7f05016c0de6726d2337032740aa29f5407cdabde0c3

.. method:: IssuingEntity.setInvestorLimits(uint32[8] _limits)

    Sets total investor limits, irrespective of country.

    Emits the ``InvestorLimitsSet`` event.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.setInvestorLimits([2000, 500, 2000, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], {'from': accounts[0]})

        Transaction sent: 0xbeda494b5fb741ae659b866b9f5eca26b9add249ae75dc651a7944281e2ae4eb

Getters
-------

.. method:: IssuingEntity.getInvestorCounts()

    Returns the sum total investor counts and limits for all countries and issuances related to this contract.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.getInvestorCounts().dict()
        {
            '_counts': ((1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
            '_limits': (2000, 500, 2000, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0))
        }

.. method:: IssuingEntity.getCountry(uint16 _country)

    Returns the minimum rating, investor counts and investor limits for a given country. Countries that have not been set will return all zero values. The easiest way to verify if a country has been set is to check if ``_minRating > 0``.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.getCountry(784).dict()
        {
            '_count': (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
            '_limit': (100, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
            '_minRating': 1
        }


Document Verification
=====================

.. method:: IssuingEntity.getDocumentHash(string _documentID)

    Returns a recorded document hash. If no hash is recorded, it will return ``0x00``.

    See `Document Verification`_.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.getDocumentHash("Shareholder Agreement")
        "0xbeda494b5fb741ae659b866b9f5eca26b9add249ae75dc651a7944281e2ae4eb"
        >>> issuer..getDocumentHash("Unknown Document")
        0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

.. method:: IssuingEntity.setDocumentHash(string _documentID, bytes32 _hash)

    Creates an on-chain record of the hash of a legal document.

    Once a hash is recorded, the issuer can distrubute the document electronically and investors can verify the authenticity by generating the hash themselves and comparing it to the blockchain record.

    Emits the ``NewDocumentHash`` event.

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> issuer.setDocumentHash("Shareholder Agreement", "0xbeda494b5fb741ae659b866b9f5eca26b9add249ae75dc651a7944281e2ae4eb", {'from': accounts[0]})

.. _issuing-entity-modules:

Modules
=======

Modules for token contracts are attached and detached through the associated ``IssuingEntity``. This contract itself is not directly modular, however any module that declares it as the owner may be attached to all the associated token contracts.
